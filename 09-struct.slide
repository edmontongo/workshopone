* Defined types

Types help us organize data.


* Adding meaning to a basic type

.play -edit 09-struct/conflation.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Enumerated constants

.play -edit 09-struct/enum.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Composite types

.play -edit 09-struct/composite.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Type declarations

- Create a new type, not an alias.

.code 09-struct/conflation.go /START DISTINCT OMIT/,/END DISTINCT OMIT/

- Operations (+, *, [], etc) of the new type are determined by the underlying type.

.play -edit 09-struct/definition.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Explicit type conversions

Conversions are possible between:

- same underlying type
- pointers to same underlying type
- numeric types
- string and byte or rune slices

.play -edit 09-struct/conversion.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/

* Struct literals

- Fields in struct literals can be given positionally or with names.
- Struct literals are addressable using &.
- Can be nested.

.play -edit 09-struct/literals.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Zero values

Missing fields are initialized to zero. If fields are given positionally, they all must be given.

.play -edit 09-struct/missing.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/

Useful zero values:

.play -edit 09-struct/zero.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Structs are passed by value

A shallow copy is made. To mutate a struct argument, pass a pointer to it. The dot operator automatically dereferences pointers.

.play -edit 09-struct/pass.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Comparing structs

Structs of the same type are comparable if all their fields are comparable.

.play -edit 09-struct/cmp.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Nesting structs

As a field:

.play -edit 09-struct/nest.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/

Including another struct's fields using embedding:

.play -edit 09-struct/embed.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT$/


* Exercises

Make a simple model of bank account using structs and functions.

- Create an enumerated constant for a bank account type: Checking or Savings.
- Create a struct for someone's bank account, including a name, account balance, and account type.
- Write a function which takes the struct as an argument and prints information about the account.
- Write the functions Withdraw and Deposit which take the struct and a positive amount and update the account balance.
