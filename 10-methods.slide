* Review: Functions

.play 10-methods/printPerson.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Review: Defined types

.play 10-methods/userType.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Method on a type

.play 10-methods/methodPrintPerson.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Methods can change data

# This code won't run because it doesn't have a pointer receiver.
# The point of this slide is to show a common error when forgetting to use a pointer receiver, which will be explained in the next slide.

.play 10-methods/incrementor.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Methods can change data by using pointer receivers

- In order to change data, the method must act on a pointer.
- The only necessary change to the `Incrementor` is to make the `Increment` function take a pointer.

.play 10-methods/incrementorFixed.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Go converts between pointer recievers and values automatically

- On the last slide, an `Incrementor` value was used to call a pointer method.
- Here, the variable `inc` is created as a pointer instead of as a value, but there's no need to change the rest of the code.

.play 10-methods/incrementorPointer.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Scope

- As with functions and variables, capitalized methods can be accessed from other packages.
- The incrementor's `int` is private, but all of the methods and the type are public.

.play 10-methods/incrementorFixed.go /type/,/}/

.play 10-methods/incrementorFixed.go /func main/,/END OMIT/

* Chaining calls

# This isn't very important and isn't special to go, so should probably be dropped.

.play 10-methods/chainIncrementor.go /BEGIN OMIT/,/END OMIT/

# Probably add a slide about automatically calling methods of embedded types, but only if the talk about user types has already explained embedded types. (Otherwise, my `Incrementor` slides need to stop embedding `i`.)

* Exercises

- Change all of the functions you created in the last talk's exercises to be methods.
