# Capstone Solutions

This directory contains a number of solutions for the capstone project. This file describes the differences between the solutions. Some of the solutions contain concepts which were not covered during the workshop (e.g. the flags package). The solutions are sorted by author.

This solution was implemented very quickly. It was used to test the server. It's a great solution if the goal is to get a working solution as fast as possible. Its error handling is not recommended for a larger project (e.g. `exitOnError` is usually bad practice), but is completely acceptable for something of this scope.
